react-native-custom-navigation
===================
The goal is making a easy navigation router for react-native, you could plug-in different navigation-bar in each view stack, and update navigation-bar background style at any time. The router would give your navigation-bar a smooth transition animation when push, pop or swipe-back gesture.

Inspired by [react-native-router](https://github.com/t4t5/react-native-router)
